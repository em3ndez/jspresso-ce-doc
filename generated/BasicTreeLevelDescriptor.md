BasicTreeLevelDescriptor
------------------------

-   **Full name** : ``

-   **Sub-types** : ``, ``

This is the base descriptor for all tree levels. A tree level is a collection of sibling nodes that belong to the same formal collection (usually a component collection property). This base descriptor does not accept nested subtrees so it is only used to describe a collection of leaf nodes. If you need to describe intermediary tree levels, yous will use one of the 2 subtypes :

-   *BasicSimpleTreeLevelDescriptor* to define a collection of tree nodes that accept a single subtree

-   *BasicCompositeTreeLevelDescriptor* to define a collection of tree nodes that accept a list of subtrees

Defining a tree level is mainly a matter of defining its representation as an individual list of components (i.e. the {@code nodeGroupDescriptor} property).

| Property                 | Description                                      |
+==========================+==================================================+
| **grantedRoles**         | Assigns the roles that are authorized to use     |
|                          | this subtree. It supports "**!**" prefix to      |
| `Collection​<​String​>​` | negate the role(s). Whenever the user is not     |
|                          | granted sufficient privileges, the subtree is    |
|                          | simply hidden. Setting the collection of granted |
|                          | roles to {@code null} (default value) disables   |
|                          | role based authorization on the node group       |
|                          | level. The framework then checks for the model   |
|                          | roles authorizations and will apply the same     |
|                          | restrictions. If both view and model granted     |
|                          | roles collections are {@code null}, then access  |
|                          | is granted to anyone.                            |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| **nodeGroupDescriptor**  | Describes the collection of sibling nodes (node  |
|                          | group) as a if it were a list view. This is how  |
| ``                       | you instruct Jspresso the type of the components |
|                          | that are used as model behind the tree nodes and |
|                          | which model property is used to compute the node |
|                          | labels. Most of the other properties defined on  |
|                          | the node group descriptor itself are ignored     |
|                          | (font, color, selection action, ...) since a     |
|                          | tree group is not a "real" view but just a mean  |
|                          | of defining a subtree. All these properties that |
|                          | are ignored on the tree group can be defined on  |
|                          | the tree view itself.                            |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| **permId**               | Sets the permanent identifier to this            |
|                          | application element. Permanent identifiers are   |
| `String`                 | used by different framework parts, like dynamic  |
|                          | security or record/replay controllers to         |
|                          | uniquely identify an application element.        |
|                          | Permanent identifiers are generated by the SJS   |
|                          | build based on the element id but must be        |
|                          | explicitly set if Spring XML is used.            |

BasicCompositeTreeLevelDescriptor
---------------------------------

-   **Full name** : ``

-   **Super-type** : ``

This descriptor is used to describe a collection of sibling nodes that each nest multiple subtrees. The children subtrees are each placed under an intermediary grouping node. For instance, given a composite tree level mapping a collection of *A*s and whose children are 2 tree levels mapping respectively a collection *Y*s and *Z*s, the tree would look like :

     parent
       -1
         
           -1.1
           -1.2
         
           -1.1
           -1.2
           -1.3
       -2
         
           -2.1
           -2.2
           -2.3
         
           -2.1
       -3
         
           -3.1
           -3.2
         
           -3.1
           -3.2
     

You can notice the intermediary grouping nodes that are installed to visually separate the 2 collection families (*Y* and *Z*).

| **childrenDescriptors**  | Assigns the list children tree level             |
|                          | descriptors. A {@code null} value (default)      |
| `List​<​​>​`             | makes this tree level a leaf tree level and is   |
|                          | strictly equivalent to declaring a {@code        |

-   **Full name** : ``

-   **Super-type** : ``

-   **Sub-types** :

This descriptor is used to describe a collection of sibling nodes that only nest a single subtree. The child subtree is directly placed under each node without any intermediary grouping node. For instance, given a simple tree level mapping a collection of *A*s and whose child is a tree level mapping a collection of *B*s, the tree would look like :

     parent
       -1
         -1.1
