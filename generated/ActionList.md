Reference for ActionList hierarchy
==================================

ActionList
----------

-   **Full name** : ``

-   **Super-type** : ``

An action list is collection of actions tha can be described with a
name, a description and an icon. Whether these information are visually
leveraged depends on the place where the action list is used. For
instance, an action list used to create a menu in a menu bar will be
able to leverage its name and icon for menu representation. If it is
used to define a toolbar part, none of them will be leveraged. The name
of the action list is also used to identify the sibling action lists to
be merged when inheriting action map together.

| Property                 | Description                                      |
+==========================+==================================================+
| **actions**              | Assigns the list of actions owned by this action |
|                          | list.                                            |
| `List​<​​>​`             |                                                  |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| **collapsable**          | Configures the action list so that it can be     |
|                          | collapsed by view factories. Collapsable action  |
| `boolean`                | lists can typically be rendered as combo buttons |
|                          | in UI channels that support it.                  |
|                          |                                                  |
|                          | Default value is {@code false}.                  |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| **grantedRoles**         | Assigns the roles that are authorized to use     |
|                          | this action list. It supports "**!**" prefix to  |
| `Collection​<​String​>​` | negate the role(s). Whenever the user is not     |
|                          | granted sufficient privileges, the action list   |
|                          | is simply not displayed at runtime. Setting the  |
|                          | collection of granted roles to {@code null}      |
|                          | (default value) disables role based              |
|                          | authorization, then access is granted to anyone. |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| **permId**               | Sets the permanent identifier to this            |
|                          | application element. Permanent identifiers are   |
| `String`                 | used by different framework parts, like dynamic  |
|                          | security or record/replay controllers to         |
|                          | uniquely identify an application element.        |
|                          | Permanent identifiers are generated by the SJS   |
|                          | build based on the element id but must be        |
|                          | explicitly set if Spring XML is used.            |
+--------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| **renderingOptions**     | Indicates how the actions should be rendered.    |
|                          | This is either a value of the {@code             |
| ``                       | ERenderingOptions} enum or its equivalent string |
|                          | representation :                                 |
|                          |                                                  |
|                          | -   {@code LABEL\_ICON} for label and icon       |
|                          |                                                  |
|                          | -   {@code LABEL} for label only                 |
|                          |                                                  |
|                          | -   {@code ICON} for icon only.                  |
|                          |                                                  |
|                          | Default value is {@code null}, i.e. determined   |
|                          | from outside, e.g. the view factory or the       |
|                          | owning action map.                               |
