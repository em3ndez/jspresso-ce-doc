Reference for ActionMap hierarchy
=================================

ActionMap
---------

-   **Full name** : ``

An action map is used to structure a set of actions. The actions are not directly registered but are placed into action lists that in turn are assigned to the action map. Action maps can be merged together, i.e. an action map can have multiple parent action maps. In that case, Action lists that have the same name are merged together. The way action maps are rendered depends on the place where they are declared. For instance an action map that is assigned to a view might be rendered as a toolbar with each action list separated into its own group. On the other hand, an action map declared on the frontend controller might be represented as a menu bar on the main application frame.

Whenever the user is not granted sufficient privileges, the action map is simply not displayed at runtime. Setting the collection of granted roles to {@code null} (default value) disables role based authorization, then access is granted to anyone.</p></td>

Permanent identifiers are used by different framework parts, like dynamic security or record/replay controllers to uniquely identify an application element. Permanent identifiers are generated by the SJS build based on the element id but must be explicitly set if Spring XML is used.</p></td>
